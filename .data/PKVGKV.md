
When you reach a certain income level in Germany, you're eligible to switch to private health insurance, known as PKV (Private Krankenversicherung). However, it's not an easy decision, as switching back to public health insurance can be difficult. In many ways, it’s a one-time, lifetime decision.

I spent some time in Germany and had trouble getting an appointment for something like a gastroscopy (Magenspiegelung), which made me feel that PKV might be a better choice if you can afford it—less waiting time and better access to preventative care. I was surprised to learn that when you're young, PKV is often quite affordable and can even cost less than GKV (state insurance). So, where’s the catch?

Quick research: the trick is that PKV might get costly once you are older. Let’s look at the most basic case: you work as an employee at a company. In this case your employer pays half of your medical insurance. If you stay with GKV this will stay the same during your retirement but instead of the employer it will be DRK (deutsche Rentenversicherung) paying the other half. They might pay for your PKV as well (if you apply for it) however no more than they would have paid for your state insurance. And no one guarantees that your premiums will stay under this limit. 

How can you know if they will? There's no guaranteed way to land on the right answer—you'd have to predict the future prices of PKV and government policies on GKV. And from where I stand, the future looks unclear. So, I plan to make a prediction about GKV and PKV prices by simulating different variables. Feel free to use the tool and input your own data as well!


#### Disclaimers:
This simulation is only valid for the most basic scenario: regular employment for the rest of your life.

I’ve probably overlooked some important factors. For instance, taxes are not taken into account here. Also, this prediction doesn’t address whether it would be more beneficial to invest the money saved on PKV in the early years and use that investment to cover the difference later in life. So, use this calculator responsibly!

I haven’t even touched on other aspects besides costs: How comfortable are you with paying bills yourself and submitting them to the insurance? Do you think it's ethical to opt out of public insurance? There are many more questions like these. Choosing insurance in Germany isn’t just about the total expenses—it involves personal values and preferences too.
